# MS-Power-Automate

MS Power Automate is a Microsoft tool, which helps us to develop business flows. 

We can design any kind of flows suitable for our business. It gives an option to capture user **Responses**, **Comments**, **Actions**, etc and store it in an Excel for analysis or reporting. 

We can also send **automatic Mails** to the business. When the flow development is complete, we have to "**Activate**" it. After activation it starts to send the step wise approval notifications to the users. The MS Flow is a **Step-by-Step process**. Untill and unless, one step is complete, the flow will not move to the next steps. The users get a notification in their Teams or they get a outlook mail, to complete the steps.
