# MS-Power-Automate
MS Power Automate is a Microsoft tool, which helps us to develop business flows. We can design any kind of flows suitable for our business. It gives an option to capture user responses, comments, action, etc and store it in an Excel for analysis or reporting. We can also send automatic mails to the business. When the flow development is complete, we have to "Activate" it. After activation it starts to send the step wise approval notifications to the users. The MS Flow is a Step-by-Step process. Untill and unless, one step is complete, the flow will not move to the next steps. The users get a notification in their Teams or they get a outlook mail, to complete the steps.
